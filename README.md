# Memory Management and Language Semantics

This repository contains three simple programs demonstrating memory management in different languages and an analysis of semantic and closure differences across JavaScript, Python, and C++.

## Programs

### 1. **MemoryManagement.rs - Rust - Memory Management with Ownership and Borrowing**
Demonstrates memory management through Rust’s ownership and borrowing system, ensuring memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

### 2. **MemoryManagement.cpp - C++ - Manual Memory Management with `new` and `delete`**
Shows manual memory management in C++ using `new` for dynamic memory allocation and `delete` for deallocation.

### 3. **MemoryManagement.java - Java - Garbage Collection**
Demonstrates Java’s automatic garbage collection, where the JVM reclaims unused memory automatically.

## Assignment2.pdf- Analysis Report: Semantic and Closure Differences
This is the report created to analyze syntax and sementics difference in JavaScript, C++ and Python.
